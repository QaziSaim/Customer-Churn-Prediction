# **Customer Churn Prediction 🚀**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **customer churn** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical customer data, businesses can identify churn patterns and take proactive steps to retain customers.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes customer details such as:  
- **Demographic Information** (Age, Gender, Location)  
- **Account Details** (Subscription Type, Tenure, Monthly Charges)  
- **Usage Patterns** (Call Minutes, Internet Usage)  
- **Churn Label** (Whether the customer churned or not)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Data processing and model training)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data cleaning and manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning models)  

## 🚀 Project Steps  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used visualizations to identify trends in churn behavior.  
3️⃣ **Model Training**: Applied multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
4️⃣ **Model Evaluation**: Assessed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5️⃣ **Churn Insights**: Identified key factors affecting customer churn.  

## 📊 Model Performance  
🏆 **Best Model**: [Model Name]  
🎯 **Accuracy**: 90% 

## 📌 How to Run the Project  
1️⃣ Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```  
2️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  
3️⃣ Open `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells.  

## 📈 Key Insights  
✔ Customers with **high monthly charges** are more likely to churn.  
✔ **Long-tenured customers** have a lower risk of churn.  
✔ Specific **services & contract types** impact customer retention.
